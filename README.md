# Steganography_Secure_Data_Hiding
This Steganography Tool enables users to securely hide and retrieve messages within images using a secret key. By leveraging the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique, it embeds text into an image without altering its visible appearance. The retrieval of the hidden message is only possible with the correct key, ensuring confidentiality.

The tool features a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, making it accessible for both technical and non-technical users. Additionally, it enhances security by incorporating SHA-256 hashing, which helps verify the authenticity of the key before message extraction.

This tool is ideal for applications in secure communication, data privacy, and cybersecurity, providing a reliable method for confidential information exchange.
